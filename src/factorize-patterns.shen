# Pattern factorization optimization

## Chez specifics

Chez doesn't provide an efficient GOTO-like construct, but
for functions defined inside of the function being processed,
if no references are made to variables in the outer scope, Chez
is able to compile calls to these functions into very efficient
jumps.

Using `hoist-labels`, all labels are converted into functions
declared with Scheme's `define` and moved to the root of the function.

Jumps to labels become direct function calls.
